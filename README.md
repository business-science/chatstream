OpenAI API app made with Shiny for Python
=========================================

To run this app, you must create a file named `keys.py`, with your OpenAI API key:

```py
openai_api_key = "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```

You also need shiny and openai packages:

```
pip install shiny openai
```

Then run:

```
shiny run app.py
```
